## Introduction

FiveM Server Lookup is an open-source project that enriches publicly available FiveM server data with additional information. The platform provides details about servers, resources, and player counts, designed for server-interested players and server administrators. Our tool makes it easier to discover and explore FiveM servers with enhanced data presentation. Contributions are welcome to help improve the platform.
